# **Python Small Projects**

### **Projects Overview**

This repository contains a collection of small Python projects, each designed to help me practice and learn different aspects of Python programming. The projects include a mix of object-oriented programming (OOP), game development, and graphical applications using libraries like Turtle, Tkinter or Pandas.

### **1. Birthday Automated Mail**
- **Description**: This project automates the process of sending personalized birthday invitation emails. It reads a starting template letter from a file and a list of names from another file, replacing the placeholder `[name]` with the actual recipient's name. The personalized emails are then saved to individual files for each recipient.
- **Skills Learned**: File reading and writing, string manipulation, automating repetitive tasks, and basic email generation.

### **2. Coffee Machine OOP**
- **Description**: A simple coffee machine built using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. This project simulates a coffee machine that can make various types of coffee, handle user input, and track resources like water, coffee beans, and milk. It calculates the money received and gives change if necessary, after which it is ready to serve the coffee.
- **Skills Learned**: OOP, class and object management, input handling.

### **3. NATO Alphabet Converter**
- **Description**: This project takes a word input from the user and translates each letter into its corresponding code from the NATO phonetic alphabet (e.g., "A" becomes "Alpha", "B" becomes "Bravo"). It uses a dictionary to map letters to phonetic code words and handles invalid input gracefully.
- **Skills Learned**: Dictionary usage, string manipulation, user input validation, error handling.

### **4. Paint Hacking (Using Turtle)**
- **Description**: A fun project where random dots are drawn across the screen using Python's Turtle graphics library. The placement of these dots is random, creating a pattern.
- **Skills Learned**: Turtle graphics, randomization, graphical programming.

### **5. Pomodoro Timer**
- **Description**: A timer application based on the Pomodoro Technique, which helps users focus by alternating periods of work and rest. The app includes a countdown mechanism for work sessions, short breaks, and long breaks, along with a visual checkmark tracker for completed work sessions.
- **Skills Learned**: Time-based automation, UI updates with Tkinter, loops, conditional logic, and applying productivity techniques in code.

### **6. Pong Arcade Game**
- **Description**: A recreation of the classic Pong game using Python and Turtle. The project implements the game mechanics for ball movement and scoring.
- **Skills Learned**: Turtle, game development, collision detection.

### **7. Quiz Game**
- **Description**: A simple text-based quiz game where users answer multiple-choice questions. The project includes user interaction, input validation, and scoring.
- **Skills Learned**: User input handling, loops, conditionals.

### **8. Rock, Paper, Scissors Game**
- **Description**: This is a simple implementation of the classic **Rock, Paper, Scissors** game. The user plays against the computer, which randomly selects one of the three options (rock, paper, or scissors). The game determines the winner based on the traditional rules.
- **Skills Learned**: Randomization, conditionals, user input handling.

### **9. Snake Game**
- **Description**: A classic Snake game built using Python and Turtle. The player controls a snake, eating food to grow longer while avoiding collisions with walls or itself.
- **Skills Learned**: Game development, collision detection, loops.

### **10. Turtle Crossing Road Game**
- **Description**: A simple game using Python's Turtle library, where the player controls a turtle that must cross a road filled with cars. The game involves collision detection, user input, and basic game mechanics.
- **Skills Learned**: Game development, event handling, collision detection, and Turtle graphics.

### **11. US States Game**
- **Description**: A geography-based game where the player guesses US state names, which are then displayed on a map using Python's Turtle graphics. The game continues until all 50 states are guessed.
- **Skills Learned**: File handling with Pandas, user input handling, Turtle graphics, and event-driven programming.

### **12. Password Manager Project**
- **Description**: A graphical password manager that generates secure random passwords and allows users to store them. The app uses `Tkinter` for the GUI and includes a password generator with letters, numbers, and symbols, and a copy-to-clipboard feature. It also allows users to store website, email/username, and password combinations.
- **Skills Learned**: Tkinter GUI design, randomization, event-driven programming, text field manipulation, clipboard handling, basic data storage.

### **Requirements**

To run these projects, you will need Python installed on your machine. Some projects may also require the installation of external libraries. You can install these libraries using pip:

```sh
pip install <library-name>
