# Python Small Projects

This repository contains a collection of small Python projects, each designed to help me practice and learn different aspects of Python programming. The projects include a mix of object-oriented programming (OOP), game development, and graphical applications using libraries like Turtle.

## Projects Overview

### 1. **Coffee Machine OOP**
   - **Description**: A simple coffee machine built using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. This project simulates a coffee machine that can make various types of coffee, handle user input, and track resources like water, coffee beans, and milk.
   - **Skills Learned**: OOP, class and object management, input handling.

### 2. **Pain Hacking (Using Turtle)**
   - **Description**: A fun project where random dots are drawn across the screen using Python's Turtle graphics library. The placement of these dots is random, creating a chaotic pattern.
   - **Skills Learned**: Turtle graphics, randomization, graphical programming.

### 3. **Pong Arcade Game**
   - **Description**: A recreation of the classic Pong game using Python and Pygame. The project involves handling user input for paddles and implementing the game mechanics for ball movement and scoring.
   - **Skills Learned**: Turtle, game development, collision detection.

### 4. **Quiz Game**
   - **Description**: A simple text-based quiz game where users answer multiple-choice questions. The project includes user interaction, input validation, and scoring.
   - **Skills Learned**: User input handling, loops, conditionals.

### 5. **Snake Game**
   - **Description**: A classic Snake game built using Python and Pygame. The player controls a snake, eating food to grow longer while avoiding collisions with walls or itself.
   - **Skills Learned**: Game development, Pygame, collision detection, loops.

## Requirements

To run these projects, you will need Python installed on your machine. Some projects may also require the installation of external libraries such as Pygame and Turtle. You can install these libraries using pip:

```sh
pip install pygame
